# ExcuseGeneratorPy

ExcuseGeneratorPy is a simple Python application that generates random excuses. It uses Tkinter for the GUI and connects to a MariaDB database to fetch a list of excuses.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python and MariaDB installed on your system.
2. Create a MariaDB database named `Excuse`.
3. Run the SQL script in the `excuse_database.sql` file to create the necessary table and populate it with excuses.
4. Update the database connection details (host, user, password) in the Python script (`excuse_generator.py`).
5. Run the Python script to launch the Excuse Generator.

Feel free to customize the code according to your needs.
